<h4 id="size">Contrast of Size</h4>

<p>The first and most basic contrast is size. <q>A simple but dramatic contrast of size,</q> says Dair, <q>provides a point to which the reader’s attention is drawn. Set in the same style of type, it maintains the exact relationship of the letter to the background. It is only a physical enlargement of the basic pattern created by the form and the weight of the type being used for the text.</q> The most common use of size is in making the title or heading noticeably bigger than the text—but that’s only a starting-point.</p>

<h4 id="weight">Contrast of Weight</h4>

<p>The second most obvious contrast is of weight: <strong>bold type</strong> <!--Strong maybe default rendered as bold but doesn't have to be, that is a CSS decision. While Emphasis is used to change the meaning of a sentence ("I love carrots" vs. "I love carrots"), Strong is used to give portions of a sentence added importance-->stands out in the middle of lighter type of the same style. As Dair points out, <q>Not only types of varying weight, but other typographic material such as rules, spots, squares, etc., can be called into service to provide a heavy area for a powerful point of visual attraction or emphasis.</q></p>

<p>The next two kinds of contrast are the contrast of form and the contrast of structure. It’s not entirely obvious where to draw a line between these two, since they both have to do with the shapes of the letters.</p>


<p>Dair is the very epitome of what I mean when I say “typographer”: someone who designs with type, not just a fancy typesetter, but someone who uses type, in all its variations, as the principle element of design. Since type carries meaning, the practice of typography requires a designer who cares about the words themselves. It requires someone who cares enough, and is skillful enough, to make the type express that meaning, rather than serve as simply eye-catching decoration.</p>

<p>The late Canadian typographer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Dair">Carl Dair</a> <!-- We will review hyperlinks again, but this is an example of an absolute link. The anchor tag, or <a>, is used when you want to create a link. You need the 'href' attribute, and its value will be the desired URL.-->was one of the great typographic designers of the 1950s and 1960s, and he may have been the best of them all at explaining the nature of typography. In coordinated projects that he both wrote and designed, he managed to describe—and show—the ways in which manipulating and using type make typography happen.</p>
